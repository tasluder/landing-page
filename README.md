Landing Page for The Odin Project

This project asked me to create a landing page for a website with an assigned color and font scheme.

***Update: 5/28/24:**
I fell off the #100DaysOfCode wagon while things got busy at work, but now that things are slowing down again, I want to get back on it! I used a tutorial for this one (I know, I know... TOP tells us not too, but I did what I needed to in order to get back on it!)*

For this project, I used the Meyer Reset from meyerweb.com.
