Landing Page for The Odin Project

This project asked me to create a landing page for a website with an assigned color and font scheme.

***Update: 5/28/24:**
I fell off the #100DaysOfCode wagon while things got busy at work, but now that things are slowing down again, I want to get back on it! I used a tutorial for this one (I know, I know... TOP tells us not too, but I did what I needed to in order to get back on it!)

OK I watched the majority of a video that talked through some big ideas on how to approach this project, and I think I'll use a lot of that to help get me started. However, it had a few elements that I didn't love so much. In an attempt to make some "reuseable modules" - the creator went down some paths that didn't seem like they were best practice for consistency. I'll use the start they gave me to get going with my own code. Let the refactoring begin... again!*

For this project, I used the Meyer Reset from meyerweb.com.
